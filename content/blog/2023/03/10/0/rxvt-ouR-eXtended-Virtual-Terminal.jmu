At the start of UNIXâ„¢, they used typewriters.  
A typewriter is basically a text-only printer, a very stupid printer.

Then dumb terminal came out,
people now we have a screen that display characters, and they liked it
because they don't need to pay for paper and ink money!

And then computer screens and X window system became famous,
so Xterm was created.

Xterm is the standard terminal emulator for X,
started in 1984; 39 years ago. 
Because Xterm is a very old terminal, barely anyone today uses it. 
Then everybody started creating their own terminal,
uxterm, mlterm, kitty, wezterm, aminal, yaft, iterm2, mintty etc.

And one of them was RXVT,
which followed the philosophy of
"Make something simple and let people expand it."

It worked, it worked so good that there is a (usable) fork of it called
RXVT-Unicode (urxvt), rxvt but with Unicode support
(which is kind of important to me so I can see emojis + Arabic scripts).

But urxvt, like suckless software, you *can* patch it to add functionality!
Some of these patches include:  
- fixing line spacing
(starting counting spacing from 1 instead of 0 was a bad idea)  
- fix transparency  
- adding smart resizing  
- adding 24-bit color support (true RGB color)  
- adding (sixel) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sixel images support   

Here it's in all of its glory

`lsix` displays low resolution images because it didn't detect the color pallet,
here is a better image example
