== Hello I am Jumps are op (or just `jumps`)

I am just yet another shell programmer. (or wizard as they call me)

You will find that I do cool shit like a
https://github.com/jumps-are-op/shelloflife
(Game Of Life implementation in POSIX shell)!

Or you may find me rewriting bash scripts into shell scripts
like rewriting  
https://github.com/daringcuteseal/whow (whow) into
https://github.com/jumps-are-op/whowp (whowp),  
https://github.com/trakBan/ipfetch (ipfetch) into
https://github.com/jumps-are-op/ippfetch (ippfetch),  
https://github.com/tatsumoto-ren/bashcities (bashcities) into
https://github.com/jumps-are-op/shcities (shcities).  
It's a bad habit, I know.

You may also find my (blogs) ://blog/index.html interesting.
